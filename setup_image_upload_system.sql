-- Ensure pgcrypto is available for gen_random_uuid()

-- 1. Create storage bucket for business images
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('business-images', 'business-images', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- 2. Set up RLS policies for storage bucket (with conflict handling)
-- Drop existing policies first to avoid conflicts

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to business images" ON storage.objects;

-- 3. Ensure business_images table exists with proper structure

-- 8. Create function to automatically set updated_at
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();

-- 9. Create trigger for updated_at
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_business_images_updated_at ON business_images;
CREATE TRIGGER update_business_images_updated_at
    BEFORE UPDATE ON business_images
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

-- 10. Ensure only one primary image per business
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ensure_single_primary_image()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- If this image is being set as primary, unset all other primary images for this business
    IF NEW.is_primary = true THEN
        UPDATE business_images

        AND id != NEW.id;

-- 11. Create trigger for single primary image
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS ensure_single_primary_image_trigger ON business_images;
CREATE TRIGGER ensure_single_primary_image_trigger
    BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON business_images
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION ensure_single_primary_image();

-- 12. Grant necessary permissions (RLS will still enforce row policies)
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON business_images TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON business_images TO anon;
